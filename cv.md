**My goal** is to make education system more effective. In this way I hope programming helps me more than everything. The important thing in my life is my family, because they are half part of me.

**Programming languages:**
* C++
* Java
* Python

**Skills:**
* 3D designing
* animating

**My last code:**

    $(document).on('click', 'a[href^="#"]', function (event) {
        event.preventDefault();

        $('html, body').animate({
            scrollTop: $($.attr(this, 'href')).offset().top - 100
        }, 500);
    });
    
I have no experience yet. But I have made many not-published mini-projects for myself.

I have studied in institute of chemical technology. I learn programming myself.
My English is not perfect and fluent, but I easily understand English materials.

**My future plans is:**
learning Javascript

learn how to develop web-site

learn how to style modern website

learn how to fix the bugs

learn debuggers
